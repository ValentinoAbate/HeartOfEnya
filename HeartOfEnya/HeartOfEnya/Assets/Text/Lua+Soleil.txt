-> Hello, Lua.
        Lua: Hey, Willow!
        Lua: Soleil has been telling me all about you!
-> Hello, Soleil.
        Soleil: Hey, Willow.
Soleil (shy smile): Come to check on us?
-> Yes.
        -> Lua, how are you feeling?
Lua: Better than before, that’s for sure!
Lua: And fantastic, now that Soleil’s here.
Soleil: Heh.
Soleil: I missed you.
Lua: Awwwww
Lua: I’ve missed you too.
Lua: Soleil says it’s been a year, but it sure didn’t feel like that. 
Lua: I’ve had a whole lot of time to think.
Soleil (neutral): ...we’ve got a lot to talk about. 
Lua: Yeah, we do.
Lua: But before you start... 
Lua: I need you to know I’m not mad at you.
Soleil (frustrated): ...It’s okay if you are.
Lua: But I’m not.
Lua: I just... didn’t understand.
Soleil (neutral):... I get it.
Soleil: And I couldn’t just… expect you to.
Soleil: I want to explain.
Lua: I don’t want to rush you.
Soleil (shy smile): It’s okay.
Soleil: I wasn’t ready then… but I am now. 
Soleil (neutral): My family...
