-> Raina is sitting outside.
        -> I should see if he’s ok.
<<goToSolo Raina>>
-> Welcome back.
Raina: Hello there, Willow.
-> You’re not sitting with the others?
Raina: I thought I’d take some time for myself.
-> You’ve had a long day.
Raina (disappointed): Yes, that’s one way to put it. 
-> You all did well.
Raina: We fought as well as we could have. 
Raina: But it was close, far too close.
Raina (neutral): You should go check on the kids.
-> Why do you say that?
Raina: They seem pretty shaken. 
Raina: It was rough out there today.
-> And what about you?
Raina: You don’t have to worry about me.
-> The others are worried.
Raina: Oh!
Raina: Are they hurt?
Raina: Maybe I should go check on them-
-> I think they’re worried about you.
Raina (disappointed): They shouldn’t be.
Raina: I’m fine, I know what I’m doing out there.
-> You’ve fought the Frost before?
Raina (neutral): Yes. Not on this scale, but I have.
Raina: I used to be part of the town guard back home.
Raina: The Frost didn’t attack often, but it was a constant threat.
Raina: Well, more frequent now, compared to a decade ago.
-> Why did you leave?
Raina: It was the right thing to do. 
Raina: Things were getting worse.
Raina: I’d get lucky each time...but what if one day I didn't?
Raina: What if it was my family next? My partner?
Raina: I was so anxious, all the time.
Raina: It got harder and harder to get out of bed in the morning.
Raina: My panic attacks started to impact my normal life.
Raina: I had to do something, to make it all stop.
-> So you left?
Raina (disappointed): Yes. I had to. 
Raina: To protect my partner.
-> But what did they want?
Raina: They… 
Raina (neutral): They asked me to stay.
Raina: But I couldn’t.
Raina: I had to know why the Frost kept coming back, why things were getting worse.
Raina (disappointed): I had to leave them behind. 
Raina: They’re safer there, in the city, where there are guards.
-> Do you regret it?
Raina (neutral): No. I can’t.
Raina: But I miss them.
Raina: Dearly.
Raina: ...And my anxiety is harder to deal with without them.
-> You are safe here. 
Raina: It may be safe in here, but it’s not out there.
Raina: Can you imagine if it was just Bapy and Soleil out here? 
Raina: We did fine today. 
Raina: But the Frost only gets stronger with time...
Raina (disappointed): Soleil barely listens to me. 
Raina: She’s better now than before, but I’m scared she’ll do something reckless.
Raina: And Bapy is just so young. 
Raina (neutral): If anything happens, it’ll be my fault.
-> You think so?
Raina: What if I’m not fast enough? 
Raina: What if I slip up and one of them gets taken? 
-> You want to protect them.
<<progressTheme>>
Raina: Of course I do! 
Raina: If I don’t, who will? 
Raina (disappointed): But I don’t even know if I can.
-> The others are worried for you too.
Raina: They shouldn’t be. 
Raina: I wish they weren’t.
Raina: I have to be okay.
Raina: I will be okay, for their sake. 
-> You don’t want them to know?
Raina (neutral): No. I can’t put this on them. 
Raina: That’s not fair for them.
-> That’s not fair for you, either.
Raina (disappointed): I- I suppose not. 
-> You want to hide it from them?
Raina: No. Well, in a way, yes. 
Raina: I don’t want them to see this part of me.
Raina (neutral): I want to be strong for them.
Raina: But it seems I’ve been worrying them even so. 
-> I think the others want to be there for you.
        -> In any way they can.
                -> Maybe you could give them the chance. 
Raina: Maybe I should.
Raina: Or at least, they deserve to know what’s going on.
-> Would you like to go talk to them?
Raina: ...I will. Soon.
Raina (smile eyes closed): They deserve that much.
Raina: ...
Raina (disappointed): I’m not sure where to start.
-> Take your time.
Raina (reassuring smile): I think I will.
Raina: I can’t carry on like this.
Raina (smile eyes closed): After all, I’m not here alone.

-> Hey, everyone!
Soleil: Hey, Willow.
Bapy (smile): Hi! 
-> Raina wanted to talk to you.
Raina: I did. 
Soleil (frustrated): Oh. 
Bapy (neutral): What’s wrong?
Raina: It’s about how I’ve been acting out there.
Soleil (neutral): You mean, how you’ve been fussing over us non-stop? 
Soleil: Never letting Bapy out of your sight?
Bapy: Soleil! 
Raina (disappointed): No, she’s right.
Raina: I’ve been scared, I think, of not being enough to protect you two.
Soleil: That’s not your job.
Raina (disappointed): I know...
Raina: But whenever I think about what could happen to you,
Raina: I get so anxious.
Raina: I'm trying to do what's best for you both.
Raina: But maybe I'm just being driven by my fears.
Soleil (frustrated): It's not like we are trying to get ourselves frozen...
Soleil: We'll be fine.
Raina: I'm sorry. I should trust you more.
Raina: You’ve both proven yourselves, over and over again.
Raina: But how do you know you'll be fine? My partner-
Bapy (neutral): Your partner?
Bapy: Wait, what happened?
Bapy: Where are they?
Raina: I-
Raina: I left them behind at my hometown...
Raina: I just wanted to make sure they would be safe.
Raina: ...I don’t know if I did the right thing.
Raina: I should have let them help me.
Raina: But I didn't know how.
Raina: I don't even know if they'll want to see me again.
Raina: ...
Raina (cry): And now I'm pushing you both away as well.
Soleil (Frustrated): ...
Soleil (neutral): You’ll go back. 
Bapy (smile): We’ll get through this. 
Soleil: You’ll just have to make it up to them.
Raina: That won’t be easy. 
Soleil: Me neither. I’m not sure if I can.
Soleil: I left my family behind for this. They don’t even know why I left.
Raina (neutral): Ah. You and Lua-
Soleil: Yes.
Bapy (neutral): Lua?
Soleil (frustrated): My family is... traditional. They wouldn’t have approved, if they’d known. 
Soleil: I couldn’t let them find out. They’d be so disappointed in me.
Soleil: And then after Lua was taken, I couldn’t- I just couldn’t explain.
Soleil: They knew something was wrong, but I didn’t even know where to start.
Soleil: So I ran away. I told myself I came out here to get Lua back, but the truth is, I ran away. 
Raina (disappointed): Oh, Soleil...
Bapy (neutral): Is that why you and Lua... 
Soleil: No. Sort of. It’s not why exactly we fought. But it was part of it.
Soleil: She wanted to meet my parents. 
Soleil: It’s not that she needed me to be out, exactly.
Soleil: But there’s just no version of us, long term, that doesn’t involve them knowing about me. 
Soleil: She didn’t want us- our relationship - to be something I was ashamed of.
Soleil: But I couldn’t let my family find out. I just can’t.
Soleil: And Lua... she comes from a different place than me. A different family.
Soleil: She didn’t understand, and I didn’t know how to explain. 
Soleil (neutral): I- I didn’t want her to think badly of us. 
Soleil: If I’d known... I should have known better... 
Soleil (frustrated): I should have just agreed with her. 
Soleil: If I had, she wouldn’t have been taken.
Bapy: I’m sure that’s not true-
Soleil: I always insisted on meeting away from crowds.
Soleil: I didn’t want to be seen.
Soleil: If we’d just been in public, or at home, maybe... 
Raina (neutral): I was a town guard, I've seen many be taken while surrounded by others.
Raina: In broad daylight.
Raina: Maybe Lua would have been safe, maybe she wouldn’t. But it’s not your fault.
Raina: Not her abduction, or your fight either.
Soleil: But if I’d just done the right thing and agreed-
Raina: I don’t know if there was really a right thing to do.
Raina: You know your family best. 
Raina: Better than Lua. If you couldn’t, you had good reason for it.
Soleil: I thought I did. 
Soleil: I just don’t know if it was worth it, now that Lua... 
Bapy (smile): But we got her back! 
Bapy: We did the impossible, together.
Raina: Lua’s safe now. 
Soleil (neutral): Is she? She’s still frozen. Where do we go from here?
Soleil: And what if she’s changed when she wakes up? 
Soleil: And that’s if she even wakes up. She might not. 
Soleil (frustrated): They say the Frost freezes the love out of people. What if...
Bapy: You’re worried she won’t love you anymore?
Soleil (cry): ... 
Bapy: Then you’ll have to get her to fall in love with you again.
Soleil: I-
Raina: You came all this way and did the impossible.
Raina: You never gave up on her before. 
Raina: You can’t give up now.
Soleil: You’re so sure she’ll even wake up.
Raina: If she’s anything like you, she’s a fighter. 
Raina: She’ll pull through.
Soleil: ... 
Soleil (cry happy): Thank you.
Soleil: I just wish I’d been braver, from the start. 
Soleil: We wouldn’t be in this mess if I’d just... 
Raina (smile eyes closed): I don’t think it’s just about bravery.
Raina: None of this, the way things are, how your family is, none of that is your fault.
Raina: There’s absolutely nothing wrong with you, Soleil. Not for this. 
Soleil: I-
Soleil (shy smile): ...
Soleil (shy smile): I think I needed to hear that. 
Raina (reassuring smile): And you are brave. Both of you are tougher than I gave you credit for.
Raina: It’s just- it’s hard to look past that, tell myself it’s okay to lean on you. 
Raina: You’re all already going through so much.
Bapy (neutral): You are too.
Raina (neutral): But it’s my job to keep you safe.
Soleil: That’s not your job.
Soleil: I understand it can be hard to ask for help.
Soleil: But what we're going through right now,
Soleil: We're going through together.
Bapy (smile): It’s on all of us, right? 
Bapy (neutral): We’ll just have to share the blame when things go wrong.
Soleil (neutral): We know we’re just kids compared to you.
Soleil: And it helps that you can take the lead.
Soleil (frustrated): But it’s hard to feel like a team when you don’t trust us.
Bapy: It’s hard to fight when I know you’re worried about me, everytime I’m out of your sight.
Bapy: I know I don’t know what I’m doing, compared to you two.
Bapy: But I’m learning!
Soleil (shy smile): It’s true. You’ve improved a lot since last week.
Raina (reassuring smile): You really have. And I’m proud of you both.
Raina (smile eyes closed): ...
Raina: I’m going to be brave too.
Soleil: I get it won’t be easy.
Raina: Yes. I'll still be fighting with my anxiety.
Raina: But I promise I’ll be doing my best. 
Raina (reassuring smile): And I hope you two will feel safe to let me know if I overstep. 
Soleil (teasing smile): Oh, we will.
Bapy (smile): Yeah.
Soleil (shy smile): And thank you for telling us. 
Soleil: It helps, knowing where you’re coming from.
Raina: That goes for you too.
Raina: It couldn’t have been easy.
Soleil: I never had the chance to talk about Lua, or us, to anyone.
Soleil: It’s weird. It feels more… real, in a way.
Raina: Yeah, I get that. 
Raina: Thank you, both of you, for giving me a chance to explain myself. For listening. 
Raina: I couldn’t be prouder of you two, I hope you know that.
