-> Hello, Bapy.[a]
Bapy[b][c][d]: ... 
-> You’re sitting so far from the others. 
Bapy: ... 
-> How was the fight today?
Bapy: ...it was okay.
-> Were you hurt?
Bapy: No, I’m okay.
-> You did well out there.
Bapy: Oh. Thank you.
-> The others seem really proud of you.
Bapy: ... 
-> You don’t think so?
Bapy: They’re being really nice, I think.
Bapy: And they’ve been helping me a lot.
Bapy: I wish I could do more... 
-> You don’t feel like you have?
Bapy: They’ve been taking care of me, this whole time, and that makes me happy.
Bapy: But I don’t know if it’s worth it... 
-> What do you mean?
Bapy: I can’t fight as hard as them. I’m just... not as strong. [e][f]
-> Do you think they care about that?
Bapy: I don’t know if that matters if it’s true, right?
-> Would you like to ask them?
Bapy: O-oh.
Bapy: I don’t know about that.
Bapy: I think I’d really rather not.
-> How come?
Bapy: I- I don’t know where I’d start, really... 
Bapy: It’s fine, it’s not a big deal... 
Bapy: I’ll just get better, and it won’t be a problem.
-> Do you think they could help?
Bapy: I don’t want to be a burden... 
Bapy: They’re both going through so much, I don’t want to bother them... 
-> You don’t think they would want to help?
Bapy: I- I don’t know.
Bapy: It’s okay if they don’t... 
-> Would you like to ask them? 
        -> It’s okay if you don’t want to.
                -> But I think you should give them a chance.
Bapy: I- I don’t know how to.
Bapy: I don’t know where to start. 
Bapy: They’ve both been so brave, talking about themselves.
Bapy: I don’t know how they did it... 
-> I don’t think it was easy for them, either.
Bapy: But I’m not like them, I’ve never done this before.
Bapy (cri) : I’m scared. 
-> I’ll go with you.
Bapy: You promise?
-> I’ll be right there with you, the entire time.
Bapy: ... 
-> You won’t be alone.
        -> I’ll be with you.
Bapy: ... 
Bapy: ...okay.

Bapy: ... 
Bapy: Hi, everyone.
Soleil (happy): Hey, Bapy.
Raina: Hi-
Raina: Have you been crying?
Raina: Are you okay? Is something-
Soleil : Raina. 
Bapy: N-no. Nothing’s wrong. Just a little cold.
Bapy: ...and, um…
Bapy: ...it’s nothing.
Soleil: ... 
Raina: …
Soleil: Hey, Bapy.
Soleil: If anything is bothering you, feel free to tell us.
Soleil: Even if it’s that the soup tastes bad or something.[g][h]
Soleil: Anything.
Raina: It’s okay if you want to take your time, too.
Raina: We’ll be here for you, whenever you’re ready.
Bapy: ... 
Bapy: I-
Bapy: Thank you…
Bapy: But I think I need to...
Bapy: ...I just…
Bapy: Willow, could you...?
-> Bapy would like to talk about something that’s been worrying them.
        -> But they’re not sure how to start.
Raina: Ah… It’s never easy, but it’s hardest the first couple times.
Soleil: Yeah. I don’t think I really learned how to open up properly.
Soleil: Not until I met Lua.
Soleil: It wasn’t that she taught me…
Soleil: Just that she gave me a reason to.
Soleil: You’re being really brave already taking this first step. 
Bapy: ...I don’t feel brave…
Bapy: Just... scared. And sort of lost.
Bapy: I just don’t know why I’m out here.
Raina: ...
Soleil: I mean, to be honest, we’re not sure either.
Soleil: Not in a bad way! You’ve more than proved your worth.
Raina: You’ve improved leaps and bounds since we met you…
Raina: But Bapy, you’re fifteen. 
Raina: I look at you and can’t help but think...
Raina: You should be in an apprenticeship somewhere.
Raina: Not out here at the end of the world.
Bapy: ...
Soleil: Do you want to talk about what led you out here?
Soleil: We both left to look for something.
Soleil: What about you?
Bapy: I didn’t volunteer, not like you two…
Bapy: My parents sent me out here. 
Raina: They what?
Bapy: I come from a big family…
Bapy: The winter wasn’t kind on our fields.
Bapy: Not to mention the Frost attacking more frequently.
Bapy: They had too many mouths to feed, not enough crops to sell…
Soleil: So… You didn’t- 
Soleil: You don’t actually want to be out here.
Bapy: I- I don’t know. When they first told me, I-
Bapy: Well, I knew what it was they really wanted...
Bapy: They just... didn’t want me around.
Bapy: But people talk about the Outpost, you know?
Bapy: My brothers used to tell me stories about the heroes out here.
Bapy: Everyone was so brave, so strong…
Bapy: I thought, maybe if I came out here, I’d be like them…
Bapy: I wanted to be more than just someone else’s baby [i]sibling.
Bapy: I just wanted to be more.
Bapy: But now that I’m out here…
Bapy: I’m still just… me. 
Bapy: As useless as ever.
Soleil: Oh, Bapy...
Raina: None of that was fair on you.
Raina: Absolutely none of it.
Soleil: How much you matter has nothing to do with how hard you can hit,
Soleil: Or how good of a kid you are for your parents.[j]
Soleil: No matter what they tell you.
Raina: You’ve got so much ahead of you.
Raina: None of it has to do with your parents if that’s what you want.
Raina: And all those heroes? 
Raina: I promise you they weren’t the way the legends make them out to be.
Raina: Right, Willow?
-> They really weren’t.
        -> They were a lot like you all, to be honest.
                -> Just people, with their own problems, doing their best.
Raina: And when this is all over.
Raina: You’ll get the chance to live your life for yourself for once.
Bapy: But I don’t know how!
Bapy: I- I don’t know what I want to do...
Bapy: Or what I would do on my own…
Bapy: You all have somewhere to go.
Bapy: You both have people who love you…
Bapy: People who’ll be there for you when this is over.
Bapy (cry): I don’t have anyone anymore.
Soleil: Don’t say that.
Soleil: You’re acting like we’re going somewhere.
Bapy: You both have people who need you…
Raina: Not as much as you do right now.
Raina: When this is all over, we can visit your family and talk to them.
Raina: It won’t be perfect, but we’ll be there for you the whole time.
Raina: And after that, what happens is completely up to you.
Soleil: I promise you, we won’t be leaving you behind.
Bapy: I-
Bapy: I just-
Bapy: Thank you…
Bapy: ...I think...
Bapy: I think I’m still scared.
Bapy: But not as much anymore.
Soleil: That’s okay.
Soleil: It’s not something you just have to believe right now.
Soleil: Things like this take a long time. 
Bapy: ...but you’ll be here.
Raina: Every step of the way.
